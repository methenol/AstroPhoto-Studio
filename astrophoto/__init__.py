"""AstroPhoto Studio: an end-to-end astrophotography pipeline for raw one-shot-colour FITS subs
(smart telescopes such as the ZWO Seestar and DWARFLAB DWARF 3, or any astronomy camera).

Stages
------
1. ``frames``      discovery, FITS/CFA handling, cosmetic (hot pixel) correction
   ``instruments`` telescope profiles: header values the telescope does not write
   ``calibration`` bias / dark / flat masters (a DWARF's CALI_FRAME, darks/ flats/ biases/)
2. ``analysis``    per-frame star metrics, registration, obstruction & cloud detection,
                   statistical + ML (IsolationForest) frame rejection and weighting
3. ``stacking``    streaming 3-pass integration: local normalization, weighted
                   sigma-clipping, optional CFA (Bayer) drizzle, split half-stacks
4. ``denoise``     self-supervised Noise2Noise CNN trained on the two half-stacks
5. ``postprocess`` gradient removal, colour calibration, deconvolution, star
                   separation, stretching, narrowband palettes, local contrast
